These files are for the project "LoveBook", which is designed to be a visual novel engine running on love2d.

Included in the github repository are the following files:
- Main.lua
- Calls.txt
- ChangeLog.txt
- VN Example

# Main.lua
Contains all the lua/love2d code, so far this is not an api but may become one at a later point once it is more complete.

# Calls.txt
Details the calls that can be made in script.txt and several notes on limitations of the system

# ChangeLog.txt
Contains different changes (later to be handled by github) but more importantly to handle goals and objectives of the system that need to be added later

To make use of this code you will need to have main.lua, middleclass.lua, and a script.txt and init.txt, the latter 2 you will be writing. 

Please read through the example folder to get a basic idea of how to use this, then read through the calls.txt for more detailed information.
